# User-Authentication-Token Authentication

 After finishing a basic API tool to manage a database of user through FastAPI I decided to go a step further by starting a bigger project. I wanted to understand better how User Authentication works and how Tokens are coded and managed through code. 
 
 With this of course I wanted to understand how hashes are managed on a server for best security practices. I used a tutorial as blueprint: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5GxQ1rLTwaU and after finishing it I added a few more features to explore how much more "complete" I could make this app.

 The features I wanted to add were a delete user, generate new users, a json file that will be automatically updated when there is a modification in the db, check what type of encryption was used if I would add a user that has his password not hashed the same way the rest of the users were and the ability for the server to keep all the changes in the db when the server is shutdown.

 Having a more in depth view of how authentication and hashing works would help me better disect and comprehend the intricaties of a secure authentication system on a website. That why I decided to tackle this project.
